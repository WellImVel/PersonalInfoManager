                            !!!Important!!!!!
      I don't use this code for personal purposes, it's just a practical matter!!.
                                   
This code can be used for various purposes related to processing user information and text data. Here are some application examples:

1. Collecting and formatting personal information
The program allows the user to enter their full name and date of birth, which can be useful for creating user profiles in various applications, for example, in registration or questionnaire systems.

2. Counting words in text files
The word count function can be useful for text analysis, for example, in educational applications where it is necessary to estimate the volume of written text. It can also be useful for bloggers or writers who want to keep track of the number of words in their articles.

3. Data analysis
The program can be part of a larger data analysis application where it is necessary to collect and process textual information. For example, in content management systems (CMS) or in word processing applications.

4. Time management
The function that calculates the number of days until the end of the year can be useful in planning and time management applications, such as calendars or reminders.
5. Educational goals
The code can be used for educational purposes to teach the basics of C# programming, work with console applications, string processing, and work with files.

6. Creating user interfaces
Although this code works in the console, it can be adapted for use in graphical interfaces, such as Windows Forms or WPF, which will create more user-friendly applications for end users.

7. Personal projects
The program can be used in personal projects to manage information, create notes, or keep a diary where the user needs to enter and store text data.
8. Integration with other systems
The code can be integrated into more complex systems such as CRM (customer relationship management systems), where user data collection and analysis is required.
